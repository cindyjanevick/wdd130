        <p>Hello everyone! Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I'm from Lima,Peru. I moved to Florida a few years ago where I met my wonderful husband, and we have been married for 5 years now. We don't have kids yet but we have 3 wonderful puppies that we love like our children.</p>
        <p>We just recently moved to Japan, and we will be here for 3 years. I love learning languages that's why I'm learning Japanese now. I love to crochet, watch anime and kdramas. My husband and I love playing board games, and I have finished and frame a lot of puzzles.</p>
        <p>I was an English teacher for several years back in Peru, a substitute teacher in Florida and an English online tutor and teacher until now. In BYUI, I'm pursuing a Software Development degree, and I'm very excited to learn all about html, CSS, JavaScript, python etc.</p>
        <p>I have been a member of the church for 14 years now, I'm grateful for the Pathway Program that let people study from all over the world. Thank for you reading my webpage, I'm looking forward to work with all of you.</p>
